    "\n",
    "In many ways, recommender systems were a catalyst for the current popularity of machine learning.  One of Amazon's earliest successes was the \"Customers who bought this, also bought...\" feature, while the million dollar Netflix Prize spurred research, raised public awareness, and inspired numerous other data science competitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommender systems can utilize a multitude of data sources and ML algorithms, and most combine various unsupervised, supervised, and reinforcement learning techniques into a holistic framework.  However, the core component is almost always a model which which predicts a user's rating (or purchase) for a certain item based on that user's historical ratings of similar items as well as the behavior of other similar users.  The minimal required dataset for this is a history of user item ratings.  In our case, we'll use 1 to 5 star ratings from over 2M Amazon customers on over 160K digital videos.  More details on this dataset can be found at its [AWS Public Datasets page](https://s3.amazonaws.com/amazon-reviews-pds/readme.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix factorization has been the cornerstone of most user-item prediction models.  This method starts with the large, sparse, user-item ratings in a single matrix, where users index the rows, and items index the columns.  It then seeks to find two lower-dimensional, dense matrices which, when multiplied together, preserve the information and relationships in the larger matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image](https://data-artisans.com/img/blog/factorization.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix factorization has been extended and genarlized with deep learning and embeddings.  These techniques allows us to introduce non-linearities for enhanced performance and flexibility.  This notebook will fit a neural network-based model to generate recommendations for the Amazon video dataset.  It will start by exploring our data in the notebook and even training a model on a sample of the data.  Later we'll expand to the full dataset and fit our model using a SageMaker managed training cluster.  We'll then deploy to an endpoint and check our method.\n",

    "In this example, we developed a deep learning model to predict customer ratings.  This could serve as the foundation of a recommender system in a variety of use cases.  However, there are many ways in which it could be improved.  For example we did very little with:\n",
    "- hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "- controlling for overfitting (early stopping, dropout, etc.)\n",
    "- testing whether binarizing our target variable would improve results\n",
    "- including other information sources (video genres, historical ratings, time of review)\n",
    "- adjusting our threshold for user and item inclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to improving the model, we could improve the engineering by:\n",
    "- Setting the context and key value store up for distributed training\n",
    "- Fine tuning our data ingestion (e.g. num_workers on our data iterators) to ensure we're fully utilizing our GPU\n",
    "- Thinking about how pre-processing would need to change as datasets scale beyond a single machine\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond that, recommenders are a very active area of research and techniques from active learning, reinforcement learning, segmentation, ensembling, and more should be investigated to deliver well-rounded recommendations.\n",
